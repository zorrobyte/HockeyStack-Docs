# Average number of touchpoints per channel to generate an opportunity

The above report allowed us to look at a single channel’s average touchpoints. A version of this report can be created to show average touchpoints across all channels.

As a pre-requisite:

1. Create your Unified Channel property:
    
    [Step 2.3 - Create your “Unified  Channel” property](../../102%20-%20Implementation%20Guide%20fdb17f2f724b401e955f879a50a9a46e/Step%202%203%20-%20Create%20your%20%E2%80%9CUnified%20Channel%E2%80%9D%20property%20852acc9b848d45e399cddb322509e34e.md)
    
2. Convert your Unified Channel property into a single “Marketing Touchpoints” goal.

Keep in mind that we have a sequence of Marketing Touchpoints → Deal Created here, showing that a marketing touchpoint happened before deal creation. **Therefore we don’t need to add an attribution model.**
