# Setting default column sort for Tables

Tables can be sorted by one column in ascending or descending direction.

To set the default sort,

1. Edit the report
2. Preview
3. Select the sort option you need by clicking on the column headers
4. Save the report while the sort option you need is set on the preview

The latest sort option saved in the Preview will be the default sort for the report.
