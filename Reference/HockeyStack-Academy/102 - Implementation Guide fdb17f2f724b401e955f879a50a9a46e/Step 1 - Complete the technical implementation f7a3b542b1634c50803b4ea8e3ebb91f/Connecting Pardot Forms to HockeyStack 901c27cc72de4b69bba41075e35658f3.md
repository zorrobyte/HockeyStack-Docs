# Connecting Pardot Forms to HockeyStack

Pardot forms live in an iframe, and cannot be tracked by HockeyStack unless you integrate your HockeyStack tracking script into the form frame.

1. Find your script by navigating to [Settings, and clicking on Integration Snippet](https://hockeystack.com/dashboard/settings)
2. In Pardot, find the “Look and Feel” tab in your form settings.
3. Add the script “Above Form”, and Save.
