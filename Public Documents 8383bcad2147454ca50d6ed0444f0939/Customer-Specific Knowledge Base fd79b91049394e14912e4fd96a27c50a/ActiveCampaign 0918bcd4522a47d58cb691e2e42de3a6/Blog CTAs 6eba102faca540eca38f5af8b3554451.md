# Blog CTAs

To track blog CTAs, we first need to define a list of CTAs.

Then, we need to translate the CTA into a goal. 

**Goals** are the building blocks of HockeyStack. You can think of it as marking an important point in the customer journey.

In this case, we want to track submissions on the HTML forms inside blog posts as goals. For this, we will need the HTML selector of the form.

Navigate to [https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/channel-marketing](https://www.activecampaign.com/blog/channel-marketing), right-click on the CTA, and click Inspect Element. You will see something like below:

All of the CTAs we want to track are inside a block called “shortcode-free-trial”.

Going back to HockeyStack, you can navigate to [https://hockeystack.com/dashboard/actions](https://hockeystack.com/dashboard/actions) to start defining this goal. Click on the + icon on the top right. The definition will look like below:

Now, we are ready to create a report based on this. You can click on Reports on the sidebar, and click New Report on the top right.

We want a report that counts the CTA completions, broken down by pages.

Now, if you want to filter this report by specific pages, you can add a filter on the breakdown.
