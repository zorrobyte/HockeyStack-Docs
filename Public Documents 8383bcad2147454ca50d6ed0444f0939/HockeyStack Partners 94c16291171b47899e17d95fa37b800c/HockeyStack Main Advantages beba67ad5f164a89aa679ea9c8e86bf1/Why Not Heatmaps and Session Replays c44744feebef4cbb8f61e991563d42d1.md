# Why Not Heatmaps and Session Replays?

Session replays are a great way to see your visitors' sessions if you have hours to watch them, or have an employee whose only duty is to watch them all day. 

If you are like most people, you don't have both. Then you will change your website dramatically based on a few sessions you watched. But were they from a specific segment? Were they returning users or first time users? You don't know these most of the time. 

HockeyStack tracks every single action and creates a step-by-step user journey for every visitor that can be filtered with session/user properties to find the exact users you are looking for. 

It takes significantly less time to analyze user sessions.

Heatmaps show you clicks and scrolls in a visual way, but then decrease your site speed. (For reference, Hojtar's script loads in 0.3 seconds, while HockeyStack's script loads in 0.03 seconds even though it also has funnels and insights) 

HockeyStack shows you each page's unique enter/exit ratios, average scroll, bounce rate, etc. and also, each click without decreasing your site speed.
