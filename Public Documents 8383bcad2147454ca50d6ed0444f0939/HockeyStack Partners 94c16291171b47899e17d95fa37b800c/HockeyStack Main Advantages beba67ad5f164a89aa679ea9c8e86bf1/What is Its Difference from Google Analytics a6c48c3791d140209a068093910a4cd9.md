# What is Its Difference from Google Analytics?

1. Many adblockers block Google Analytics, so the data is not really accurate.
2. You need a cookie banner to use Google Analytics, HockeyStack is cookieless.
3. Google Analytics's script is 6-7x heavier than HockeyStack's script, which means it will decrease your site speed.
4. If you want to get actionable insights from Google Analytics, it will take hours to dig into your data and find them. If you have an employee who is in charge of analytics, this will cost you a lot of money. Whereas in HockeyStack, we divide analytics into 4 main categories: Goals, Funnels, Users, and Insights. Setting up a funnel takes under a minute for the majority of our users, and creating a goal takes under 30 seconds. You can get insights with a single click. You will save time and money. 
5. You don't need to tag any event, everything is collected automatically.
6. If you don't define a goal and later want to define it, you cannot get historical data from Google Analytics. No matter when you create your goals or funnels, you can always get the historical data from HockeyStack.
