# Creating a Narrative and POVs

Created: June 7, 2023 5:53 AM

Having your company become active on LinkedIn is a great thing, but you need to structure your approach if you want to accomplish your goals.

For this reason, you need to have a solid understanding of your company's narrative in the market.

This helps you focus your topics on a central theme and remain consistent with your messaging across dozens of (or however many) team members.

You can then talk about the things you want to talk about through the lens of your company's narrative.

Properly doing this over a period of time is what will allow you/your teammates to educate your market.

### Your Company’s Narrative

A *strategic narrative* is a story of an imagined future captured in a “before,” “now,” and “to be” sequence. It’s a story of the old game (the declining status quo) vs. the new game (the emerging way to win).

- Gong created “revenue intelligence”
- Zuora coined the term “subscription economy”
- Drift came out with “conversational marketing”

These were all ways for people to **adapt** to new behaviors in their market.

These companies made it clear that the way things currently were (aka the “old game”) was no longer the best way to do something, and that the winners were already playing “the new game.”

At HockeyStack, we’re building a narrative around and ushering in the era of Attribution 2.0.

What is your company’s narrative?

Your goal is to understand this narrative and come up with POVs that can help you spread this narrative to your audience.

This is crucial to the success of this playbook, since the topics of your posts will stem from your narrative.

### Your Company’s POVs

Your POVs are the angles you establish to spread your narrative.

For example, at HockeyStack, our narrative is built on [Attribution 2.0](https://hockeystack.com/attribution-2-0-blog-series), which is the mindset of using attribution as a way to better understand your customer’s journeys, as opposed to using attribution to understand which team or channel gets credit for a conversion.

To spread this narrative, we broke it down into three unique points of view:

1. The way we think about attribution needs to change
2. Better understanding the customer journey leads to better GTM alignment
3. Better understanding the customer journey leads to more memorable marketing

Following the process laid out for us by the [Realm of Relevancy](https://podcasts.apple.com/ua/podcast/the-easy-mode-framework-part-3-strategy/id1638429490?i=1000588694254), we broke each of these POVs down into three Sparks.

Here’s a simplified version of our narrative in RoR format (doesn’t include Subject Matter):

**POV 1:** The way we think about attribution needs to change

- Spark 1 - Attribution is not only about proving ROI.
- Spark 2 - The majority of the industry still uses and relies on flawed attribution.
- Spark 3 - Attribution is about collecting and analyzing more data.

**POV 2:** Better understanding the customer journey leads to better GTM alignment

- Spark 1 - Different departments currently operate in silos.
- Spark 2 - All teams (sales, marketing, product, CS) need access to attribution and customer journey data.
- Spark 3 - Teams need to have shared goals that focus on business growth.

**POV 3:** Better understanding the customer journey leads to more memorable marketing

- Spark 1 - Proving ROI gets you more leadership buy-in.
- Spark 2 - Free up marketers to do more creative marketing and brand building.
- Spark 3 - Building a media company makes activities more trackable.

As you’ll notice, every single bullet point in this breakdown is a topic we can create tons of different content on.

## Putting Them Together

Once you've put together a Realm of Relevancy for your narrative, you can just pick a topic and create content around it, and it’ll always be something that is tied back to your company’s goals, your audience and their interests, and your product, because the topic stems from your narrative, and your narrative was built taking all those things into account. 

So, quick recap, here's what you want to do:

1. Create a story or a narrative around a new way and old way of something in your industry. Not something that you’re making up, but a change or major shift you’ve observed, such as how A2.0 is about the evolution of attribution as we know it, from using it to see which team or channel gets credit for a conversion (i.e. old game) and using it to better understand which interactions collectively impact our customers journeys as a whole (i.e. the new game). So, craft that story or that narrative. 
2. Break that narrative down into 2 to 3 unique perspectives, or POVs. These POVs are what establish or flesh out your narrative. 
3. Break down those POVs into further points, use all of these points, perspectives, and stances as topics for your content.
4. Embed these topics and perspectives into your existing content, such as your blog posts topics, your podcast episodes, your webinars, whatever marketing activity you’re doing and build your own content around them.
5. Finally, make your LinkedIn profile a combination of your own content posted on those topics and your company content on those topics (such as any series you might’ve created). 

When you consider the [Content Journey](https://hockeystack.com/academy/episodes/content-journey), [Memorable Experiences](https://hockeystack.com/academy/episodes/memorable-experiences), and [Substance & Delivery](https://hockeystack.com/academy/episodes/content-repurposing), you can create endless content out of the topics in your realm.
