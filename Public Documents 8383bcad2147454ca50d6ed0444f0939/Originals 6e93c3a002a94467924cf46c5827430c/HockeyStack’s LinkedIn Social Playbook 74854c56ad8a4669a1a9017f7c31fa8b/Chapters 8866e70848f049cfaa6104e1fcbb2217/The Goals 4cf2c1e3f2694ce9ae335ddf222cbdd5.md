# The Goals

Created: June 7, 2023 5:53 AM

Though your long-term goal is to create demand for your company, there are some other goals that you should aim for along the way:

* **Increased engagement**: you want more relevant engagement (conversations, support, etc. vs. meaningless comments like ‘I agree’) from relevant people (i.e. folks in your ICP, your customers, prospects, or people in your field vs. random people from random professions)
* I**ncreased followers**: You want more followers, but you want to make sure you’re attracting a specific group of people, rather than anyone and everyone
* **Increased performance**: as you begin to understand your audience more and more, your posts should gradually perform better over time
* **Increased output**: by refining your strategy over time and cutting down on ideating/writing time, you’ll be able to increase your weekly output
* **More opportunities**:  Seeing a rise in opportunities like podcast invites, consultation/side-gigs offers, etc., is a good sign that what you’re doing is working

## Parting Advice

As you grow on the platform, you’ll start gaining more attention, will have more people messaging you, tagging you in posts, etc.

At first, it can be overwhelming and difficult to keep up with it all.

Here are some tips on that front to help you out when the time comes.

### **Meeting with Others**

You should try your best to reply to all the DMs you get and keep conversations going. The more you grow these relationships, the more you grow your network.

You can even offer to consult for free, let people ‘pick your brain’ on Zoom calls, etc.

However, keep in mind that you’ll always want to limit your ‘yes’s,’ so you don’t end up with too much on your plate at once, or end up burning yourself out.

### **Setting Up a Calendly**

If you don’t already have one, set up a Calendly link.

Use this link to quickly set up times to meet with others.

### **Implement Self-Reported Attribution**

You’ll want to implement self-reported attribution, at the least.

This way, once your content begins making an impact on pipeline, you’ll know it, since you’ll start to see people mention your content in their SRA submissions.

### **Declining Opportunities**

It’s totally okay to say ‘no.’

Whether that’s to a podcast invite, a gig offer, a Zoom chat, or whatever.

If you’re too busy, have a lot on your plate, if it’s not worth your time/effort, or you simply don’t want to, remember that it’s 100% okay to decline.
