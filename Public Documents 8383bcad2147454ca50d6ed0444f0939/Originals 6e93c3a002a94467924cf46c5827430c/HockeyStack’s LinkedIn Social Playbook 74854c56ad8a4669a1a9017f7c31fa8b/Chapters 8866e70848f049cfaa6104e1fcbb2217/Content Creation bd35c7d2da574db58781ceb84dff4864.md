# Content Creation

Created: June 7, 2023 5:53 AM

There are many different ways to approach native content creation for LinkedIn.

Here are some important aspects of content creation to keep in mind.

### Intentions

One of the most important things about executing a strategy is understanding what you’re hoping to accomplish.

Yes, your goals for the long-run are increased brand perception, higher intent leads, and all that, but what are your ****goals for **each individual post**?

It’s probably to educate. Or inspire. Or get engagement.

To do that in a meaningful way, your content needs to provide value.

Yeah, super cliche, I know.

But this could mean giving them a new way to do something, a new way to look at something, better questions to ask, make them ponder, make them laugh, etc.

As a result, the goal for each individual post is for it to benefit the person it's for.

If you have to give away all your best marketing/sales/leadership secrets and tactics to do that, and make people wonder why you’re giving away such awesome information for free, that’s a great start.

### The Reading Experience

Chances are, you’ve seen the line-by-line posts on LinkedIn. Many posts are structured this way because it makes the post **easy to read**.

And the success of your content relies on its ability to keep the reader engaged.

This is why things like hooks are important.

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_brand-is-not-your-logo-your-colors-or-your-activity-6975531935057993728-sx0u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

However, hooks aren't everything.

There's more to consumption than getting someone's attention.

You also have to hold it. And then you also have to make that time spent (however long or short it may have been) worth it for them.

This is why you should go further than just hooks and also prioritize **structure** and **substance**.

—> the **hook** brings readers in

—> the **structure** allows them to glide through it (the less effort they have to put into the *actual act of reading*, the better)

—> the **substance** you provide makes it time well-spent for them

This is the reading experience.

It’s more than just writing a good hook ****to catch the reader's attention. You also have to hold that attention and do something with it.

This is why structure ****and substance ****are important, as well.

Especially substance.

You could have the best hook, and the best structure, but if it is ultimately content that provides generic or common substance, your posts won’t continue to perform well.

That's why it’s important that you build your content around a unique POV that stems from expertise in your industry.

Respecting the reading experience of your audience is one part of achieving steady growth.

### Coming Up With Ideas

One of the most common issues creators face is coming up with ideas. And that’s totally okay.

Luckily, there are a few things you can do to get over creative slumps.

- **Have conversations with peers, colleagues, and on LinkedIn:** Talk to experts on your team or schedule Zoom calls with people from LinkedIn who work in a similar role as you. The more you actively engage in your industry and the more conversations you have with people in your field, the more you will find things to write about or create content around.
- **Engage with people in comments:** Ask people questions, expand on their points, and be curious. As you dive deeper into conversations on specific topics, you’ll find unique things to talk about and expand on in your posts.
- **See what people are talking about**: By browsing your LinkedIn feed and seeing what others in your industry are talking about, you can almost always come up with a way to add on to a topic, come up with a rebuttal, an interesting approach on the matter, etc.
- **Seek out new people who are creating impactful content**: Find people in your industry who are creating insightful or interesting content. Message them and kick off a chat. This works better with smaller creators and is a great way to network and collaborate with others.
- **Talk to your customers**: Talking to your customers and understanding their hurdles, challenges, goals, successes, etc., can help you come up with solutions and methods to write about that others in your audience will also find helpful.
- **Talk to people in your target audience**: You can message people on LinkedIn or set up calls with prospects. Having regular calls with more and more people in your TAM will give you things to create content around.
- **Apply ideas from areas outside of marketing to marketing**: Whether it's video games, YouTube shows, movies, etc., think of how you can recreate or adapt mainstream content to be relevant for your audience (more on this later in the guide).

### Types of Posts

Now, before you get back into things like writing posts or writing comments, I want you to check out some of the different **types of posts** you can create on LinkedIn.

You know you need to lead with an engaging hook, structure the content so it’s easier to read, and make sure your posts provide insightful substance.

Let’s put it all together by looking at different types of posts.

1. **The List Post**

List posts are a great way to present a set of rules, steps, changes, tactics, myths, benefits, etc.

They work well because they provide the reader with insightful info in an easy-to-read manner.

Here’s an example of a list post:

![Screenshot_20230613_071615_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230613_071615_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/officialg_marketing-activity-6897210009105879040-bidu?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web))

And me giving it a shot:

![Screenshot_20230525_005706_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_005706_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_just-to-sort-of-point-out-that-content-marketing-activity-6890384270310133760-1LRs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

The next time you have an idea for a post, try turning your message/substance into a list of benefits, tactics, etc.

1. **The Systems Post**

This is a post where you present your info/substance as a system broken down into several parts. You can also think of it as an actionable How-To Post.

These posts usually provide your reader with a simple way to do something complex.

For example, if you’re writing a post about setting up Zapier automations for project management, you’ll want to break it down into a system that takes someone from point A to point B through clearly defined steps.

Here’s an example of a systems post:

![Screenshot_20230525_005131_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_005131_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7054894355160920064-ATEk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

Mine isn't as good, but I tried:

![Screenshot_20230525_004806_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_004806_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_heres-a-unique-and-creative-way-to-repurpose-activity-6920041114523590657-fkLX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

Structuring your post this way will make it easier to comprehend and **implement** your advice, as opposed to it being a wall of text (even if it is line-by-line).

1. **The Conversation Post**

One uncommon, but effective way to present your substance is through a conversation.

These types of posts work well with readers because it allows them to imagine and play out the posts in their minds, like a “mental movie.”

These conversations can be presented as stories, like something you’d see in a novel:

![Screenshot_20230613_071432_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230613_071432_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eshleyner_copywriting-marketing-creativity-activity-6921471664761262080-SWyd?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web))

And you don’t have to be a pro to make it work:

![Screenshot_20230525_004726_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_004726_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_so-what-advice-do-you-have-for-people-who-activity-6932037937672953856-jKCf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

A lot of the ideas we come up with stem from conversations that we have with our colleagues, customers, and peers.

So, the next time that’s the case for you, instead of trying to extract the lesson from your conversation, try writing the conversation out like it happened - as if you were writing a book.

1. **The Quick Post**

It always helps to learn how to be more concise. That’s where the Quick posts come in.

These posts are super easy to get through and pack value.

Your sentences are short, you follow a line-by-line structure, and you add visual queues (such as emojis, bullet points, etc.).

The goal here is to help your reader consume your content without much effort or spending too much time on it.

![Screenshot_20230525_004704_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_004704_LinkedIn.jpg)

**([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_not-entirely-sure-who-needs-to-hear-this-activity-6912427439113535488-G0wF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))**

As you can see, it’s much easier to get through this post than it is to get through one that's pushing the character limit.

When you’re rushing into a meeting and only have 15 seconds, you’re more likely to read this type of post than a longer one.

Do keep in mind though that this writing style mostly works for people who post writing tips.

As mentioned earlier, they have a much more general audience (consisting of anyone who wants to learn how to write better online).

And you’ll see over time that your audience (mostly likely consisting of experts in sales, leadership, or marketing), prefers more nuanced thoughts, practical advice, and actionable steps, as opposed to quicker explanations.

Therefore, study these posts to learn how to write more concisely, but don’t rely on this approach altogether.

1. The Promo Post

One mistake that many creators make is that they don’t know how to properly promote off-platform content.

Whether it’s a blog post, a YouTube video, or a podcast episode – most creators simply share a link. At most, they’ll write a short summary and leave a link in the comments.

The problem with that is that this post is no longer actual content for LinkedIn. It’s just a post promoting something else.

What you need to do is make the “promo” a good, standalone LinkedIn post in its own right, then mention the off-platform content as a supplementary source – a way to dive deeper on the topic if that person is interested.

But before you can get someone to dive deeper into something, you need to develop an interest in it. That’s why your LinkedIn post needs to be a solid post, whether or not you’re promoting something else.

Like this:

![Screenshot_20230525_011008_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_011008_LinkedIn.jpg)

Or like this:

1. **The Video Post**

Video has taken off on LinkedIn. Many people have been able to build strong, sustainable followings through video posts alone.

And there are three easy ways you can begin experimenting with video content:

1. *Record yourself going over your text post*

The fastest and easiest way to create a video to go along with your post is to find an area with some good lighting, pull up the camera on your phone, and record yourself talking about whatever you covered in your post.

This also gives you a chance to dive into details that you weren’t able to cover in your text post, such as, more examples, extra insights, etc.

![Screenshot_20230525_004635_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_004635_LinkedIn.jpg)

**([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/toddclouser_want-to-make-videos-but-you-suck-at-talking-activity-6955472244043038721-sol0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))**

1. *Grab video from a Zoom call or podcast recording*

If you’ve appeared as a guest on a podcast before, you can create multiple video clips out of the recording.

If you haven’t been on a podcast, don’t worry! You’ll get plenty of opportunities to do so in the coming months.

Either way, you can still get some video clips by simply recording a Zoom call:

- Plan out some questions/prompts
- Jump on a Zoom call with a peer from your company or your network
- Hit record
- Riff on your prompts/discuss the questions you wrote down with your buddy
- End the call, save the recording
- Locate 1-minute to 3-minute segments from the video recording where you’re talking about something interesting, intriguing, actionable, etc. that you feel your audience would benefit from hearing
- Write out what you go over in each video clip as an actionable LinkedIn text post
- Enjoy publishing your new videos

1. *Come up with a concept and create a skit*

If you want to go beyond a simple video, you can add a concept to it. This is where "edutainment" can come in handy.

Instead of talking/presenting, you can deliver your insights through humor.

Whether that’s through a skit, a show/series, a parody, etc., is up to you.

For example, you can talk about how content marketers associate the word “content” with “blog posts,” and how they need to move beyond it, [like this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_as-content-marketers-we-need-to-start-seeing-activity-6928438723827126272-lLDF?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) or [like this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_content-marketers-we-have-to-get-out-of-activity-6938144057470713856-1qGd?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web).

Or you can record a skit of yourself growing increasingly frustrated with how the advice content marketers provide always leads back to blog posts:

![Screenshot_20230525_003616_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_003616_LinkedIn.jpg)

In the beginning, you can collaborate with other, more established creators to make skits and get the hang of it.

For example, my first skit was with [Todd Clouser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddclouser/), who was already killing it at the time.

![Screenshot_20230525_012025_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_012025_LinkedIn.jpg)

And if you’re active on TikTok, you can repost those videos:

![Screenshot_20230613_071222_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230613_071222_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justwillaitken_saleshumor-tiktok-startup-activity-6942819015962615808-KIDS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))

Humorous content that is built for your audience on a topic relevant to your industry works well for community and audience engagement.

It's actually a good way to take the *broad reach* aspect of general or quick content, and mix it with the *targeted engagement* aspect of more nuanced content, since you're delivering the same substance your audience cares about in a funny way.

At the end of the day, everyone loves to laugh, so if you can pull it off in a way that’s relevant to your audience and your industry, give it a shot.

1. **The Experimental Post**

Once you’ve found your footing, established a voice, and started growing a following, you can begin/try experimenting with different types of content.

I’ve tried two things:

- Streaming myself playing video games while talking about marketing
- Turning my thoughts on marketing into rap lyrics and making songs

Both, in their own ways, “worked.”

![Screenshot_20230525_013120_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_013120_LinkedIn.jpg)

**([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_marketing-leadership-career-activity-7065047968436908032-nvGi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))**

People bring up the video game/marketing content all the time on sales calls and [the songs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4D6S6Wv48MyLNh4W8ivaxZ?si=lUAIdxz7T26-2dE0qlfJVQ&utm_source=copy-link) gave me a type of content to create that my audience loves.

![Screenshot_20230525_003119_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_003119_LinkedIn.jpg)

**([source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/obaid-khan-durrani_so-like-10-days-ago-i-posted-a-video-of-activity-6922660198171959297-bj1u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop))**

**Now, this is not to say that you should start streaming video games while talking about Sales or start rapping about Leadership.**

The underlying thought process behind this content was:

"*Create content built on the actual interests of my audience while making it relevant to what we do and enjoyable in a workplace environment by tying it to our field and balancing entertainment with insights that stem from a unique POV."*

An easy way to do this if you want to try it out is to think of mainstream entertainment, and make it about your field.

Such as [Emily Brady’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-dibrito-brady-841005121/) spin on The Onion for B2B:

Ultimately, it’s up to you, but just know that there’s a lot of inspiration out there and you don’t have to try to invent something from scratch.

1. **Video Snippets**

Once you start creating video or podcast content, you can repurpose the video into native LinkedIn content.

Even better if you use a custom template, like this:

![Screenshot_20230525_020200_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_020200_LinkedIn.jpg)

([source](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6991450554916823040?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6991450554916823040%29))

It’s worth experimenting with when you get to a certain stage of consistency with video.

1. **The Simple Text Post**

Now, sometimes it’s best to keep it plain and simple.

But just because you’re whipping up a simple line-by-line text post, doesn’t mean you can’t add some extra flair or style to it.

This is where things like bullet points, dashes, and slashes (or even images, GIFs, and memes) come in handy.

![Screenshot_20230613_071030_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230613_071030_LinkedIn.jpg)

In the early stages of your content creation journey, when you’re just trying to build up a habit of posting, you might want to keep things simple.

And that’s totally cool. In fact, I'd recommend it.

The goal isn’t to turn every post into a Conversation post or a Systems post, it’s to be consistent and purposeful.

![Screenshot_20230525_013155_LinkedIn.jpg](Content%20Creation%20bd35c7d2da574db58781ceb84dff4864/Screenshot_20230525_013155_LinkedIn.jpg)

Even if moving forward you find that sticking to a simple text-post format is the best way for you to communicate your POV, do yo’ thang, fam.

### Writing Posts

Now, let's go over how you can actually write posts.

There are a few ways to do this:

- **Batch create** Block time on your calendar to write out multiple posts. You can also do this on a Sunday. Once you have several posts ready to go, you can also use a social media tool to schedule your posts. The only downside to this is that it takes a lot of time + your posts might not always hit.
- **Think of stuff as you go** You can write posts as they come to you. You can react to current conversations in your industry or something you found that your TAM is curious about. You can also have conversations with peers, colleagues, and customers and use it as a source of inspiration for your posts.
- **Use LinkedIn as a distribution channel** Once you get to a more stable stage of content creation, you/your company might be creating YouTube shows, a podcast, TikTok content, etc. You can use LinkedIn as a primary distribution channel and use that existing content to supply your content strategy.

For reference, I don't batch create. I started off writing posts as I thought of them (for the longest time), and now I'm trying to use it more as a primary distribution channel.

If you're just starting out, I'd recommend you write posts as you go, and then switch to using it as a primary distribution channel once you've built up a cadence and an audience.

### A Quick Content Creation Checklist

Whenever you’re about to publish a post, ask yourself:

- If you were your reader, would you be glad you read this post (or watched this video, etc.)?
- Does it share a unique perspective?
- Is it related to your industry?
- Does it educate (whether or on your narrative or your product) or entertain?
