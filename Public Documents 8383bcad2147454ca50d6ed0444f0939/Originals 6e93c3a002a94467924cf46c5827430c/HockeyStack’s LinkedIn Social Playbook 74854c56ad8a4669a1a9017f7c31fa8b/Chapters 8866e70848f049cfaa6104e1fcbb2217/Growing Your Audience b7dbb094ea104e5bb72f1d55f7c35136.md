# Growing Your Audience

Created: June 7, 2023 5:53 AM

Now that you’ve got your narrative out of the way, we can focus on our LinkedIn activity.

When you're just starting out on LinkedIn, there are a few things you want to do build your foundation:

- Connect with industry peers and people from your target audience
- Follow popular content creators in your niche
- Familiarize yourself with the people in your industry

Here's how you can go about accomplishing this:

- **Find inspiration** find at least 10 people who are either creating the type of content you want to create (and it’s performing well), or are well-established in the space you’re looking to establish yourself in, or both. You can do this by:
    - going through the ‘My Network’ tab
    - seeing who your connections interact with
    - looking up lists, like LinkedIn Top Voices
    - filtering the search results to show followers of a popular creator in your field
    - searching for something like "top funded b2b SaaS companies in 2023" on Google, pulling up a list of 50, going through each company on the list, pulling up their list of employees from their company LinkedIn page, and then adding their leaders, senior marketers, senior sales people, etc.
    - To make things easier, here's a list of [90+ B2B creators worth following](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLkQBjYN2xBCLPY8Aw0SPPwP8J7oODN5__KLs5Jklhw/edit?usp=sharing). There's no ranking system, or criteria, or order or anything – I just like what/how they post.
- **Stay notified** – once you find those 10 people, ring their notification bell so you get notified every time they post (you can find it on their profile across from their name).
- **Learn from them** – in the beginning, you’ll want to study their content to find recurring patterns and uncover their writing styles. You’ll also want to take note of the types of comments they reply back to (i.e. what do these comments have in common? Which ones receive a simple “thanks” and which ones kick off conversations?).
- **Engage with them** – From there, you can start commenting on their posts, and after a while, message them to thank them for making awesome content, encourage them to keep it up, etc.

However, keep in mind that you don’t need to restrict yourself to only commenting on these people’s posts.

Showing up on their posts (while the posts are less than 24 hours old) with insightful or supportive comments can help you grow a relationship with them (as well as their audience) over time.

It’s also how you can gain them as supporters of your content when you start posting.

And finally, by commenting on posts, you'll eventually start getting lots of likes on your comments. These likes help you in a few ways in the beginning.

1. **They help you find your voice** – you can see which comments performed the best, which type of comments they were, what you were talking about, etc. and do more of that.
2. **They help you find your space** – you can go down the list of people who liked your comments and add the ones who are relevant to your industry. This helps you find that "pocket" within your industry that your content resonates most with, and you can build your audience by connecting with more of those people.
3. **They help you get started posting** – you can always flesh out comments that did well and turn them into posts. It's an easy way to get started with posting and oftentimes, high-performing comments make for high-performing posts.
