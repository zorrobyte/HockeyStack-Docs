# HockeyStack’s LinkedIn Social Playbook

# Hey there 👋

I’m Obaid, Head of Content @ [HockeyStack](https://hockeystack.com/?utm_source=seo+playbook&utm_medium=notion&utm_campaign=playbook).

A year ago, we started our LinkedIn journey with almost **0 followers, no traction, no influence.**

Here’s what we gained by using this playbook in **12 months**:

- Millions in pipeline
- 45% MoM revenue growth on average
- 15+ podcast interviews
- 20K+ followers
- Got into Y Combinator

In this guide, I take you through the whole process. Short & concise.
