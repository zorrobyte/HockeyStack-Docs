# Optimizing

Created: July 24, 2022 3:25 PM

We started optimizing our articles at around 50 articles & 1K traffic. 

I prioritized quick wins first then slowly got to the majority of articles. 

I divide the optimization process into 4 different parts:

- Ranking
- Not ranking
- Relevancy updates
- Blogs to merge

## Ranking

If an article ranks on:

- lower side of the first page
- second page

put it in this category.

## Not Ranking

Don’t need explanation

## Relevancy Updates

These updates can be about a new integration that you have, new pricing plans, or your new position. Whatever you changed about your brand, product, or company can go into this category. 

Hot tip: If you are on WordPress, use custom blocks for pricing and other repeated sections, so that you will only need to update the custom block and not all the blog posts that have that section. 

## Blogs To Merge

If two articles are ranking for the same keywords, you can merge them. Make a list of those articles and start merging them. 

Merging relevant articles works like a charm. I had an article that I merged that went from 70th spot to 5th in 10 days.

Depending on the category, you can create a different strategy. 

For ranking articles, we are using Surfer’s inputs and templates similar to this one: 

The template looks like this after the writer completes editing:
