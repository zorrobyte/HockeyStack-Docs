# Moving Towards The Mid-funnel

Created: July 24, 2022 3:26 PM

After you got to a high volume, rank for the majority of bottom-funnel keywords you targeted in the first month, and started optimizing your articles, you can move towards the mid-funnel articles.

These keywords will have more volume, higher keyword difficulty, and a lower buyer intent than the bottom-funnel keywords.

Mid-funnel topics are usually about your product use cases. These can be listicles, (top SEO analytics dashboards) how-to articles, (how to create an SEO dashboard) guides (SaaS SEO analytics guide), SEO analytics template for SaaS, etc. 

You can reduce the volume after 1-2 months of publishing mid-funnel articles to 20-25 articles per month so that you have enough time to optimize your articles as well.

These are not bottom-funnel articles, but you should still write about your product in them without pushing the customer to a demo.

Placing your product in relevant places and then retargeting these visitors with ads across platforms is the best long-term play.
