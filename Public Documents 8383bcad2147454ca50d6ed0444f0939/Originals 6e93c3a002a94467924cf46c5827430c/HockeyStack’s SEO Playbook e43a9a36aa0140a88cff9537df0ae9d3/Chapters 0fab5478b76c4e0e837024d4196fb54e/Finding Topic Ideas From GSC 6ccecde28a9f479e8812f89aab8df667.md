# Finding Topic Ideas From GSC

Created: July 30, 2022 7:37 AM

As you publish 40 articles per month and then decrease it to a lower, but still a decent volume, you will run out of topics to write about.

At that point, you probably have some organic traffic that you can use to uncover new topics for your articles.

Export queries to GSheets, then filter them by:

- at least 100 impressions in the last 28 days
- ranking in the first 25 (to rank for these fast)

Then you can run the list on Ahrefs to find out the ones with a higher CPC, and you can start with those.
