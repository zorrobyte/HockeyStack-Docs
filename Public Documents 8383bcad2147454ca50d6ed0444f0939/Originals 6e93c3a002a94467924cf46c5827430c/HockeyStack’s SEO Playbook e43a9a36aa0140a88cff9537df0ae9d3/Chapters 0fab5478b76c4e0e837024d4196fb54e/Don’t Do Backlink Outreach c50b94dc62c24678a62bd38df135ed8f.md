# Don’t Do Backlink Outreach

Created: July 24, 2022 3:26 PM

Backlink outreach never worked for us. 

Creating the list, outreach with personalization, getting replies, writing guest posts, rounds of edits, getting them published with follow ups, and finally getting backlinks.

😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨

Instead we have a tactic that’s called statistic articles by SEO influencers on LinkedIn and getting sold for thousands of bucks on Gumroad as a course. 

To put it simply:

- Create a statistic article relevant to your audience
- Get it rank fast with images, tables, videos, etc.
- Wait till it ranks (or start with Google Ads)
- Done

This articles help you get backlinks at scale with 0 outreach. When people are writing articles, they need statistics to make them more enticing and convincing. 

They search on Google to find relevant statistics and when they find a good one, they add it to the article & of course give a backlink in return!

Example:

This is an article in which we complied statistics from different websites. (and gave backlinks/credits) We added tables, images, and relevant information, and we are at the 1st spot for this keyword with ranking for nearly 200 keywords.

I thought we were lucky and decided to try it once again a couple of weeks ago. 

Did it once again with average lifetime value by industry.

We are at the 2nd spot right now and getting organic backlinks with no outreach.

Another cool way to get backlinks naturally is getting expert opinions & turning the opinions into statistics in the article.

These are super easy to distribute on social as well.
