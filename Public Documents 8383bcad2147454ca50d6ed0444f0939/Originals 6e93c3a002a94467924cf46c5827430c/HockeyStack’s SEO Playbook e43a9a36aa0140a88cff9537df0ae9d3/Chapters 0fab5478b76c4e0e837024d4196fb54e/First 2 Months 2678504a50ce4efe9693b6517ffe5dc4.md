# First 2 Months

Created: July 24, 2022 12:56 PM

First month is all about setting the foundations and starting publishing. FAST.

If you haven’t published 30-40 articles per month before, this will be hard when you first start. It’ll get easier with time though. 

I wouldn’t start publishing or even designing the blog before setting up the foundations, such as article guidelines, progress tracking board, and WordPress.

Depending on how much each writer can write & the contract, you would need between 5-8 writers to reach this volume. 

If each writer can write 2 articles per week, 5 writers would be enough. 

To test the writers, we asked them to write a part of an article. We gave them an example outline, quick info about HockeyStack, and the trial article was 600 words.
