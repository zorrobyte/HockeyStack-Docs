# Tracking Content Success & The Funnel

Created: July 24, 2022 3:01 PM

First of all, content success is not equal to signups. 

You shouldn‚Äôt expect people to read a couple of blog posts and signup immediately. 

Yes, it does happen like the example below, but often it takes time & effort.

using HockeyStack

## How we track content success:

First of all, we are tracking boring metrics, such as

- Keywords ranking
- Organic non-branded traffic
- Impressions
- CTR

These are on Search Console & Ahrefs.

Using HockeyStack, we are tracking:

- Weekly/daily signups (live demo views)
- MRR/signups from blog posts (multi-touch)
- Bounce rate/session duration by blog post
- Content lead quality
- User journey

## Example dashboards:

### User journey with all marketing & sales touches across channels

### Blog posts that drive revenue

### Content Lead Quality

### Overview

![Ekran Resmi 2022-07-26 12.00.54.png](Tracking%20Content%20Success%20&%20The%20Funnel%2071cd386b81564c149989c35bc39b085d/Ekran_Resmi_2022-07-26_12.00.54.png)

However, the customer journey is not linear as you know. (me after I wrote this sentence: ü§¢)

These dashboards give very important insights, but not the full journey. 

We are also using HockeyStack‚Äôs surveys & attribute signups/revenue to survey responses, have customer interviews, etc. to complete the puzzle. 

## Setting Up The Funnel & Things We Tried

Your potential leads don‚Äôt know their stage at the funnel you created and treating them like they do know doesn‚Äôt help you get more of them to the bottom of the funnel. 

![Ekran Resmi 2022-07-24 22.04.51.png](Tracking%20Content%20Success%20&%20The%20Funnel%2071cd386b81564c149989c35bc39b085d/Ekran_Resmi_2022-07-24_22.04.51.png)

BUT

You still need to know what you would like your readers to do after they read a bottom of the funnel article. 

We failed (learned from) a couple of experiments while doing this. Let me share them with you:

## Bottom-funnel Landing Pages

We created bottom-funnel landing pages like this one: [hockeystack.com/marketing-analytics](https://hockeystack.com/marketing-analytics) and linked to those pages on the sidebar depending on the category

So if the category of the post is marketing, we had a link to marketing analytics. If the category is product, we got a link to product analytics. You got the idea. 

It didn‚Äôt work because we didn‚Äôt get much clicks to those buttons on the right side of the article. 

## Agressive CTAs

![Ekran Resmi 2022-07-24 22.16.36.png](Tracking%20Content%20Success%20&%20The%20Funnel%2071cd386b81564c149989c35bc39b085d/Ekran_Resmi_2022-07-24_22.16.36.png)

I tried being more aggressive on the ‚Äúvs‚Äù articles. 

Didn‚Äôt work. 

## Exit-intent Popups

We are still (with some hope) trying exit-intent popups, but they haven‚Äôt worked a single time so far. Maybe the offer is wrong?

![Ekran Resmi 2022-07-24 22.18.17.png](Tracking%20Content%20Success%20&%20The%20Funnel%2071cd386b81564c149989c35bc39b085d/Ekran_Resmi_2022-07-24_22.18.17.png)

Testing different headlines right now, and will report back on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emircatli/) :) 

## What We Did Next?

Right now, we are adding a couple of screenshots of HockeyStack in all bottom-funnel articles that are the most relevant for the topic. 

We then ‚Äúwant‚Äù the reader to check out our [live demo](http://hockeystack.com/live-demo) because they will be able to see those screenshots & will be relevant to them.

Since we gated our live demo, we can get their emails and when we follow up, they don‚Äôt get annoyed as they are interested in HockeyStack‚Äôs offering. 

Also, we incorporated a retargeting ad strategy to target people who are reading our bottom-funnel articles. 

This might not apply to all product. As HockeyStack is a bit more complex than most SaaS tools, we need to be more relevant & add more steps to the funnel.
