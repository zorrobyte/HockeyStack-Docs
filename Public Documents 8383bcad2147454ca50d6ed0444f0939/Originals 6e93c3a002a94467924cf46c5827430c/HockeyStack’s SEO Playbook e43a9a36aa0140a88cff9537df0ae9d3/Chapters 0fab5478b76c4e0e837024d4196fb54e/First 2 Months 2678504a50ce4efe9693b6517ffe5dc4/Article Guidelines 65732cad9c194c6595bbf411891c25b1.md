# Article Guidelines

Without clear guidelines, your writers won‚Äôt be able to understand what your brand‚Äôs style is, how they should talk about your product, how to structure an article that is aligned with your goals, etc.

Below, you can see an example guideline we are using. I got inspired from my friends at Content Distribution, added some parts that are relevant for us, and edited the majority of the guideline to make it aligned with HockeyStack.

You can do the same and use this one for yourself.

# Content Outlines

Most articles you write will come with a content outline. The content outline‚Äôs goal is to enable you to create valuable content on a subject you may not personally be an expert in

- **H2s**
    - We will provide direction & examples under each H2
    - **For additional context, google the H2**
    - If the H2 is ‚ÄúBest Marketing Conferences‚Äù, google ‚ÄúBest Marketing Conferences‚Äù and research
- **Tables**
    - Tables are used to summarize data, make data easier to consume, or add additional value to the reader
    - You can use a table whenever it makes sense. Possible ways to use a table:
        - To compare a tool's features
    - Do not use more than 6 columns per table for aesthetic reasons
- **Internal links**
    - Each article will include at least 5 internal links
    - Find natural areas to link to the content

# Technical Requirements

Each article should include the following, at minimum, unless stated otherwise in the content series template:

- 2500 words
- 3 lists (1,2,3,4, etc)
- 3 sets of bullet points
- 2 tables (if it makes sense)
- 5+ internal links
- 3+ external links

# Internal Linking For SEO

## What are Internal Links?

Internal links are links to our existing articles on our blog. If you mention a term or a concept that we have previously written about, then you should add a link to that article for better SEO and user experience. [Read this article](https://yoast.com/internal-linking-for-seo-why-and-how/) to learn more about internal links.

 You can find examples below. 

1. **The more internal links you have, the better. The bare minimum is 5, but if you can add 20 internal links naturally, go for it.** 
2. Necessary internal links will be provided
3. You must naturally link to these pages in your content
4. **Never leave bare links in the articles. Anchor = URL of the article you are linking**
    1. **Example: if you‚Äôre linking to the article: soxy.com/blogs/what-to-wear/how-to-wear-a-beanie, the hyperlinked text should read ‚Äúhow to wear a beanie‚Äù**
5. Don't use sentences like "you can read this article on marketing reach." **Internal links should be natural.**
    
    Examples:
    
    ![Untitled](Article%20Guidelines%2065732cad9c194c6595bbf411891c25b1/Untitled.png)
    

![Untitled](Article%20Guidelines%2065732cad9c194c6595bbf411891c25b1/Untitled%201.png)

# Internal Linking For Value

1. If you see any opportunity to link to a blog or a page that is not listed in the spreadsheet, but adds additional value to the user, do it!
2. **Search the website for additional internal links that are relevant to the article.** 
    1. Google site search: site:[website] [main-keyword]. For example, if you‚Äôre working on the DoNotPay project and looking for information about parking tickets, you will search: site:[donotpay.com](http://www.donotpay.com/) parking tickets

<aside>
üí° ALL LINKS SHOULD BE OPEN IN NEW TAB (BOTH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL)

</aside>

# External Linking

1. Do not link to the reference articles provided
2. **Do not link to any articles you find on the first 5 pages of Google for the core keyword, or the H2s you google.**
3. Never link to competitor websites (sites that are ranking on the first page of the google when you search for the title of this article)
4. Always add a link if you mention a statistic

## Duplicate Content

If you reference content from the client‚Äôs or 3rd party websites, you must not copy/paste. The goal of your writing is to rank in Google, and Google will not rank duplicate content.

**Content that is found to be copy/pasted will be rejected, our relationship will be terminated, and we will attempt to recover any money paid for duplicate content.**

**Do not spin your own content.** The editorial team reads every single article multiple times and we will always notice if you reuse paragraphs from your previous articles.

# Style

- Use active voice
- **Use I, not we. Example: I recommend you to use X. (Not we recommend you to use X)**
- Write like a partner who is trying a SaaS business scale their marketing
- **Paragraph length should be 2-3 sentences**
- **FAQ lengths should be 4-5 sentences at maximum**
- **Never use sentences that lack confidence. For example, I will try to explain, I should probably do, etc.**
- All the headings under a heading 2 must be heading 3, not bullet points, bold sentences, italics, etc.
- If you are writing a list, use "." not "-." **1. 2. 3. 4. not 1- 2- 3- 4-**
- Short Intro: Cut your clever anecdotes unless it's specifically thought leadership or an essay.
- Short Conclusion: Summarize the main point in 2 to 3 sentences. Leave the other stuff for an FAQ

## Words and expressions that you must not use

- let me explain, let me do, etc.
- I will try to
- I want to
- Many of you know, already realized vs
- I should probably
- consumer (in tech, it‚Äôs a user)
- we

# Audience

You are writing for people working at SaaS (software as a service) companies, who are:

- Tech-savvy
- Looking to solve a problem with the article you are writing or get inspired
- Already know about the topic you are writing about so you don't have to start from 0. Example: If you are writing about SaaS Email Marketing, you don‚Äôt have to explain what SaaS is. People who search for ‚ÄúSaaS email marketing‚Äù already knows what SaaS is & look for additional resources to level up their email marketing game.
- Usually senior level marketing people

## How To Write A Good Intro

1. Find statistics related to the subject of the article

Examples: if the article is about content marketing, search for SaaS content marketing statistics on Google; if it‚Äôs a comparison article for seo tools, search for SaaS SEO statistics

1. Use the statistic as a hook (often, the first sentence of the intro works best)

Example of a hook: ‚ÄúThere's a marketing strategy that more than [70% of marketers](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics) are investing in: content marketing.‚Äù

1. In the sentences that follow the hook, define the subject and emphasize the importance of it for businesses

Example of a paragraph that would follow the hook: ‚ÄúEvery SaaS company is publishing new content each second, and you have to constantly upgrade yourself to compete. Thus, as a content marketer (or simply as a person involved in SaaS marketing), you should be aware of the tools, questions, and metrics that will keep improving your content marketing strategy.‚Äù

1. Finish the intro with a short sentence that starts with a pharse like ‚ÄúIf you want to learn more about‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúTo learn more‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúKeep reading to learn more about‚Ä¶‚Äù

# Quality Assurance

Each article will be evaluated by your editor. Some of the things they will look out for:

- Duplicate content?
- Is the content more valuable than the other first-page search results?
- Are there grammar or spelling issues?
- Has each technical requirement been met?
    - 2 tables
    - 3 lists (1,2,3,4...)
    - 3 bullet point lists
    - 2,500 words
    - At least 5 internal links
    - At least 3 external links
- Does the article follow the content guidelines?
- Does the voice of the article match the guidelines provided?
