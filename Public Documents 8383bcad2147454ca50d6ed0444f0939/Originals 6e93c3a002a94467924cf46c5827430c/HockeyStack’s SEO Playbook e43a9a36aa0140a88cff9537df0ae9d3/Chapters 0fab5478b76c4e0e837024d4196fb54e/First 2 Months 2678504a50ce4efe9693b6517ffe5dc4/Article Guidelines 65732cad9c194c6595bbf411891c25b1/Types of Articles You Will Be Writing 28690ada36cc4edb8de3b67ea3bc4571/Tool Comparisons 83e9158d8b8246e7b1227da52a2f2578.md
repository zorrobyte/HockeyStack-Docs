# Tool Comparisons

In the tool comparison articles, you will be comparing two software products that SaaS companies need in their tech stack to help them make a better decision. 

## Company Summary

Write a few sentences about the company that you are writing about.

Summarize the tool's features and add a list of the features. Example:

## Integrations

Add a list of the tool's integrations, a screenshot from their integrations page, and a link to their integrations page.

## Pros

After doing your research on the tool, its features, and reviews, you can write about its pros. You should be objective and not over exaggerating. 

You should bold integral parts of the sentences so that readers can easily skim through the article.

## Pricing

When writing about pricing, you should first list all pricing plans available, including special plans, such as startup plans. 

After that, you should add a screenshot of their pricing section and a link to their pricing page.

## Reviews

You can search for tool reviews on [G2](http://g2.com) or [Capterra](http://capterra.com). Reviews help you understand the tool better and write a better article.

They also help people make a better decision when deciding on buying a tool for their need. 

Summarizing their integrations, adding a list, and a screenshot of their integrations page is enough for this section.
