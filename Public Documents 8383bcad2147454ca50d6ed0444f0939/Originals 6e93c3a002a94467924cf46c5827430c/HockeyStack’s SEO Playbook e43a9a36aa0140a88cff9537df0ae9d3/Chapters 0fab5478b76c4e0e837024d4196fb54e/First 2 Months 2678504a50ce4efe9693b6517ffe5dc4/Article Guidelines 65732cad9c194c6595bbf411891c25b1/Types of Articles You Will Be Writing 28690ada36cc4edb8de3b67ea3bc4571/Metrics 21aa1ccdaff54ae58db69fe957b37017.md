# Metrics

This type of post is a listicle of metrics that a SaaS team can track to measure their performance. 

## Definition

Start writing about the metric with a definition. Definitions should start with "X is the percentage/rate at which." Example: **The customer retention rate is the rate of customers you’ve kept after a specific time period.**

Briefly summarize what the metric is about and include an image if that makes sense.

## Why is it important?

To explain why this metric is important, do the necessary research and add your opinion too. Example:

Your monthly customer retention rate is a neat little summary. **It shows you how well your customer service has been doing, or how good your product has been working based on customer satisfaction.** However, it’s important to remember that this rate is just a rate. It doesn’t tell you everything you need to know about customer retention, and only checking this metric would mean that you’re missing out on other important aspects of brand loyalty.

## How to calculate?

Add the formula and explain what the terms in the formula mean. Add an image of the formula to better visualize it.
