# How-to Guides

We write ultimate guides to educate people on a certain topic. These guides have different sections, such as definition, how is X (topic you are writing about) different from other industries, step-by-step strategy, and conclusion. 

## Definition

You should write a brief definition of the concept and explain it in simple terms. Usually, there are opportunities for internal links in this section.

## How is X Different

SaaS and other industries have a ton of differences as SaaS companies mostly depend on subscriptions, not one time payments. At HockeyStack, we are targeting web-based SaaS companies, and all this makes them put a huge emphasis on retention and their web presence.

## Strategy

By doing your research on the topic and using the outline, you will create a step-by-step strategy for your readers.
