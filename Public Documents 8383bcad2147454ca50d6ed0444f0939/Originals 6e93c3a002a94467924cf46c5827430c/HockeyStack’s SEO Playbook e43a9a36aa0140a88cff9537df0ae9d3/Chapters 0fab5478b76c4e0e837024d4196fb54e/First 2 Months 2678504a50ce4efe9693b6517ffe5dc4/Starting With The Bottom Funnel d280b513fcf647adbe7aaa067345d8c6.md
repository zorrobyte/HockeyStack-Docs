# Starting With The Bottom Funnel

The first 2 months of this strategy will be publishing bottom-funnel content very fast and dominating all those keywords.

To start with, you will need to write down all the competitors you have & those you want to compete with. 

Don’t be fooled by the search volume on these keywords. It’s usually much higher than what Ahrefs says. 

There are a couple of different types of articles you will be writing, such as

- X vs Y (competitor comparison articles)
- Top X Alternatives (competitor alternatives articles)
- Top X Software/Tools (X is your category)

We didn’t do these ones yet, but you can also try:

- “Competitor” reviews
- “Competitor” pricing
- “Competitor” signup

After coming up with all the competitor names, you can start drafting your first articles. 

## Internal Linking

Internal linking is REALLY important for your rankings. In your alternative pages, you will write about various tools and you will also write about their alternatives. Don’t forget to add internal links to all of them so that a user who is doing their research can easily navigate between your alternatives articles. 

## Placing Your Tool In The Articles

Placing your product in the right place in these articles is the most important part in this strategy. You should not be too salesy and you shouldn’t push the reader to your product. Everything should be natural. If not, you will see an increase in your bounce rate.

A couple of ways to put your product in these articles:

- Just before the conclusion as an alternative to the two products you compared
