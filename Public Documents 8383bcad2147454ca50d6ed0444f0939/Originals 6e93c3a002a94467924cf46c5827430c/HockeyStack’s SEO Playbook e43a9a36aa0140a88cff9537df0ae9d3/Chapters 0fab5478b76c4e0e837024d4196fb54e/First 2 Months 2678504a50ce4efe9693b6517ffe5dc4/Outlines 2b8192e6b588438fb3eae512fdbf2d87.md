# Outlines

One of the major mistakes companies do when publishing content is not giving outlines to writers.

Even if you are working with an experienced writer, you should have an outline because they won’t know about your brand’s style, your product, which points you want to be included in the article, etc.

With a detailed outline, you will also save your editor time as they won’t need a ton of rounds back and forth with the writer to edit the article. 

Here is an example one for one of our articles:

Talk about using metrics such as time spent in usage, stickiness, and feature usage to determine how effective the design is and how easy the product is for users to understand.

Also mention how surveys can help you ask users very specific questions about the UI and how it can be improved.
