# Campaign structures we are running

<aside>
🏒 These will probably change over time as they are not perfect. I’ll talk about the experiments we ran and their results as well. So take everything with a grain of salt.

</aside>

We are running 7 main campaigns:

- Testimonial ads
- Product ads
- Video ads
- Intent trigger ads
- Meme ads
- “Creative” ads (not memes but not directly about the product as well)
- Retargeting ads

---

We mainly target **maximum reach for the campaigns that are not necessarily for conversions & campaigns that we will later use for retargeting people.** 

We use website visits goal for conversion-aimed campaigns and see good results. 

Right now, I am testing every campaign with the website visit goal with reach as well to see if it really makes a difference. So far, CTRs for the reach campaigns are CRAZY, but we don’t get much pipeline from it.

On the other hand, website visit campaigns have a much lower CTR, but they turn into pipeline. 

Our list is relatively small too, so I don’t know what’s happening here. I’ll give it a little bit more time to understand better what’s going on. 

Although we are using the same list, people clicking on the reach campaigns tend to spend MUCH less time on the website, and their bounce rates are much higher.

So I have yet to learn how LinkedIn does this, but somehow, even though we are using the same list for both campaigns, people clicking on or seeing the website visit campaigns are higher intent.
