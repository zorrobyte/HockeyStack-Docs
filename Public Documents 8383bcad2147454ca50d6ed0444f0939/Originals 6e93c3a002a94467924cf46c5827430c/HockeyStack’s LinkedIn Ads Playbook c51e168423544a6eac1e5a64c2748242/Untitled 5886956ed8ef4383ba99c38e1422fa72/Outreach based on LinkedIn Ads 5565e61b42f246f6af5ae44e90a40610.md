# Outreach based on LinkedIn Ads

Early intent signals are as important as the actual conversions. However, most marketing and sales teams ignore them. 

Some early intent signals on LinkedIn are:

- Ad engagement: likes, comments, reposts, etc.
- Engagement score
- Impression
- Bottom funnel page views (pricing, signup, contact sales, etc.)

If you have a social strategy on LinkedIn alongside your paid strategy, these signals are beneficial for outreach. 

We target marketing executives, so we connect with these people after we see an early intent signal from the company or one of the prospects at the company. 

Once they accept the connection request, they will see our posts daily on their feed. (we post 2x daily)

They will know who we are, what we do, and how we do it. During this time, they will continue seeing our ads too.

Eventually, they will check out our playbooks, The Flow, and our product.

Once the time is right, we will be the first option without any alternative in their minds. 

This is how demand gen works.

You can also test outreach sequences, templates, or call scripts to reach out to accounts with early intent signals. 

According to my experience, the timing matters a lot. If you reach out early in the journey, it might backfire and ruin the experience.

A humorous template just before turning it into SQL works very well for us.
