# Optimization

I optimize our campaigns every week to identify low-performing campaigns. 

What I look at while optimizing our LinkedIn campaigns:

- CTR vs impressions
- Spend (whether a precious campaign, such as testimonials, is not spending as much as I aim to)
- CTR over time (indicates ad fatigue)
- Cost per opportunity
- CPC over time

### Website metrics I look at:

- Bounce rate and session duration based on campaigns
- Intent signals, such as visiting the pricing page, filling in some parts of the contact sales form, signing up for the Flow newsletter, etc.

We try to change the majority of our ads every week and keep the frequency between 5-10 on the reach campaigns.

Usually, if an ad is performing super well when you first run it, its performance will start dropping after 2-3 weeks. You can either change the creative and design it from scratch, or you can change the essential elements of it, such as background, colors, etc. 

What I like to do is change the essential elements first and then change the design entirely after a couple more weeks pass.
