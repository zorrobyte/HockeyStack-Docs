# Targeting

At this point, we know our ICP pretty well.

Our ads target B2B companies with 100-500 employees with at least 5 people in their marketing team.

At first, we tried using LinkedInâ€™s native targeting features to get to the right audience. But, doing a deep dive into the traffic, we quickly realized that all the filters there are crap. We were basically wasting half our budget on useless traffic.

Our current strategy is to create hyper-accurate account lists and then apply native exclusions on the list to target the exact people we want. The process to build the list is:

1. Scrape a foundational list from various sources using in-house tools.
2. Take a sample of 20 random accounts and go through them manually to measure accuracy. Initial accuracy is usually ~60%.
3. Try different filters based on all the parameters we have scraped, and then test accuracy by sampling again. If the filter works to increase accuracy significantly without decreasing the size of the list too much, we save it to use later in different lists. Right now our saved filters get us to around 90% accuracy, and then we are usually able to bump it up to ~95% with additional filters.

My co-founder is offering free 15-minute 1:1 brain-picking sessions on the topic, feel free to [select a time from his calendar](https://calendly.com/bgrgndzz/15min).

An additional benefit to using account lists is that you get access to the Engagement Report, so you can see and act on high-intent accounts.
