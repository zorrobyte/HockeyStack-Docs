# Testing the creatives on social first

As I said before, people see LinkedIn ads and your posts on your page on the same feed in the same format.

Whenever I have a genius (ðŸ¥¸) idea, I first test it on social. This allows me to see the engagement and get feedback from the same people that I am gonna pay to get in front of for free. 

The opposite way works as well. If an ad campaign works very well, you can repurpose it multiple times on LI and FB or create similar campaigns.

If other people in the company use the creative or the campaign on their pages, you can multiply the effects.

Usually, marketers succeed with a campaign and never utilize it elsewhere. 

Squeeze the juice out of that campaign.
