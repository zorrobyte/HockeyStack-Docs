# Experiments we ran and the results

## Background

We tested background colors heavily on different creatives. The best-performing one was this:

Almost all creatives performed worse with a single-color background. 

Itâ€™s important to note that we change the creatives almost every week to overcome ad fatigue so even though one background works well, we change it after a week or 10 days as CTRs decrease.

## Uploading Audiences

Uploading audiences to our LI ads account has probably the highest ROI among everything we did. 

We can track the engagement of our audience and see the impressions/engagement on the account-based journeys using HockeyStack, it helps us with our ABM motion for a small number of accounts, and the targeting is much better using our lists. 

This is not a test, but I still hear companies donâ€™t have uploaded lists on their accounts during the product demos with B2B companies. 

If you want to learn about how we get these lists and use them, you can book a 15-minute call with us [by clicking here](https://calendly.com/bgrgndzz/15min), and we can chat more about it and answer your questions. (not a sales pitch)

## Message Ad

Message ads have become massively popular with Metadataâ€™s recent content on their effectiveness. 

Message ads didnâ€™t work for us, but we tested them before uploading lists to our account. I will test it more with uploaded lists rather than LinkedInâ€™s targeting options. 

## Hey SaaS Marketer

All the lists we use on our ad campaigns are B2B SaaS companies, and we target marketers.

I thought acknowledging this and putting it right into the creative might show our prospects that we 100% know who are target is & increase engagement. 

It worked well, with a decent increase in CTRs & engagement:

We also tested this in our social posts as the first line:

Using every opportunity, you have to show your target audience that you:

- know who they are
- know their pain points
- have the solution for their pain points

Is one of the most underrated tactics in B2B marketing. 

## Memes

Our top-performing ads in terms of pipeline influence and influence on closed won deals are memes.

Not just usual templates, though.

Here is an example featuring my co-founder, BuÄŸra ðŸ¤“

This has been a very successful experiment with lots of influence on the pipeline. 

I am now testing templated memes with a reach objective on a broader audience + memes similar to this, pointing to the pain points of our prospects with a website visit objective.   

## Twitter Screenshot

I had an idea to create fake Twitter screenshots and advertise these

A fun experiment and something I didn't see before

People ask for recommendations online, so creating that same conversation with a Twitter screenshot should work, right?

NO

Almost %0.1 CTR, spends more money than other creatives (don't know why, but maybe due to their size, the frequency might be more), and had 0 engagement

Of course, I knew people wouldnâ€™t believe this was real. My main goal was to disrupt the pattern with this ad & stop the scroll.

One thing that contributed to this failure might be the size of the image. 

As itâ€™s a Twitter screenshot, the images were tiny. 

Anyways, don't try at home
