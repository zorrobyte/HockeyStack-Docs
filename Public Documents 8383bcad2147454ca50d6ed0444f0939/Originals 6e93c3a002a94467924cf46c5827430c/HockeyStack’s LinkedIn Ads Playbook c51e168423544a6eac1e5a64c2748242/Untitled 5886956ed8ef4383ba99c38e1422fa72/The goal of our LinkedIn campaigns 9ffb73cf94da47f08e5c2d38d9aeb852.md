# The goal of our LinkedIn campaigns

Everything we do serves one purpose:

Being everywhere that our audience spends time in

In every single Slack channel, every day on their LinkedIn feed, on Google search with our SEO, and The Flow, our new media department

The overall aim of our LinkedIn campaigns is the same

We do this with different types of campaigns, though, not just product screenshots and videos

We are using:

- memes (lots of memes, actually)
- videos
- single image ads
- spotlight ads

and more

We want our audience to say:

These guys are smart, they know the space well, they know my pain points, and they are interesting. Iâ€™d love to work with them.
