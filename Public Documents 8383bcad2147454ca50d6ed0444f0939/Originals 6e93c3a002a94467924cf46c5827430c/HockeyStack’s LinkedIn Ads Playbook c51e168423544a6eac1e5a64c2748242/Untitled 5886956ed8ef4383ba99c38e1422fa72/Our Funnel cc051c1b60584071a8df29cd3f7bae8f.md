# Our Funnel

We have a simple funnel:

![Frame 183.png](Our%20Funnel%20cc051c1b60584071a8df29cd3f7bae8f/Frame_183.png)

It’s our landing page ⇒ live demo, which is gated ⇒ contact sales or pricing ⇒ booking a demo

Sometimes we reach out, not spam, though, to prospects who also enter the live demo

We also try to measure the influence of different channels on our funnels and try to test as much as possible, including campaign goals, creatives, UTM terms, etc., to find out the best-performing ones in our funnels. 

Here is an example from [our live demo](https://hockeystack.com/live-demo/?utm_source=linkedinplaybook):

Our growth heavily depends on having more people land on our website and then checking out our live demo, so we test everything to have:

1. more people on our website
2. more people check out our live demo

I am surprised that only a few SaaS companies have interactive product demos on their websites. 

I get why they might not have a free trial, but a live demo helps a TON to show/use the product before the prospects sign a contract with you.

Also, your money page might not be or won’t be a live demo, depending on your product. 

We understood our live demo was our money page because almost all the prospects who booked a demo were checking it out. 

Once we understood that, we decided to invest more into our live demo, including the UX, templates, and overall experience.

Other potential money pages might be:

- documentation
- use cases
- benefits
- persona pages
