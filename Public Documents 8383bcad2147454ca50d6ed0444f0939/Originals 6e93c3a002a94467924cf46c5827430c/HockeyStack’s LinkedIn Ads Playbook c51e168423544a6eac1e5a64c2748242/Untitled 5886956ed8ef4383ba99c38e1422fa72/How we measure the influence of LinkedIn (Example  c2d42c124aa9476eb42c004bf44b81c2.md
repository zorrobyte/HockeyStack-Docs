It‚Äôs mission-critical to have the right tracking system in place so that you can measure the value created by your LinkedIn ads campaigns. 

## An overview:

I check out this section of our dashboard weekly to see if everything is going according to the plan.

The most important pieces for me are paid pipeline ROI and cost per opportunity.

## Customer journeys for higher value deals

We are not heavily focused on ABM, but we are tracking their journeys carefully for our higher ACV deals with a longer sales cycle. 

If the account is closed, we go back and check all the touchpoints across platforms that led to the conversion.

If the deal is still progressing, we check out the journey to understand the account's stage and the touchpoints and try to understand how we can move the deal forward.

We segment the accounts & users with their actions and properties. Some example segments we use to filter our accounts and users:

## Direct Influence (Last touch)

Although it‚Äôs rare, sometimes our prospects see one ad, click on it, and book a demo. 

We are using a last-touch dashboard to measure these conversions and their pipeline influence.

## LinkedIn ads view & engagement influence (Conversions happening on other channels)

Most of the time, more than one ad is needed to get people to your website, not even conversions.

We track the pipeline influence of LinkedIn ad view/engagement. We also track how many impressions/engagements an account needs before scheduling a demo to come up with common customer segments so that we can replicate these to generate more SQLs.

An example:

- 500+ people in the company
- 200+ impressions on LI ads
- Very high engagement score
- Targeting 5 marketing leaders in the company
- 10 website visits
- 6 SEO touchpoints
- Connected on LinkedIn with the decision-makers
- Signed up for The Flow
- Checked out our SEO playbook

If we get this list as accurate as possible, we can create more SQLs by replicating customer journeys across platforms.

It‚Äôs easier to do it because we can track each account's touchpoints across platforms.  

You cannot do this if your current tech stack only allows tracking the last touch.
