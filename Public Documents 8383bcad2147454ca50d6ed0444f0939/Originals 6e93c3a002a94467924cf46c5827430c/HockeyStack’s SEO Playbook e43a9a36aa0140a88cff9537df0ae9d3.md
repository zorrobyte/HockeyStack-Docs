# HockeyStack’s SEO Playbook

# Hey there 👋

I’m Emir, Co-Founder & CMO @[HockeyStack](https://hockeystack.com/?utm_source=seo+playbook&utm_medium=notion&utm_campaign=playbook).

6 months ago, we started with **0 traffic, 0 DR, 0 authority, 0 blog posts.**

In **6 months**, we:

- reached **~7K** ranking keywords
- reached **~10K** clicks per month
- reached **1M+** monthly impressions
- decreased our CAC by a lot
- were able to do ABM with minimum effort

No backlink outreach, and 95%+ of the keywords are bottom of the funnel.

In this guide, I take you through the whole process. Short & concise.
