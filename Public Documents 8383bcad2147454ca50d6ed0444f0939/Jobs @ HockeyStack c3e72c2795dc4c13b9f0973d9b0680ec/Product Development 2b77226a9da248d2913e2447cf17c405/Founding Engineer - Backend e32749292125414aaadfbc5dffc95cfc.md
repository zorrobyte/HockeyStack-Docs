[HockeyStack](https://www.hockeystack.com) is an analytics and attribution tool for B2B SaaS. It collects and helps analyze data from all parts of the SaaS customer journey - marketing, sales, and product engagement. Our goal is to make tracking and gaining insights from all this data easier and faster.

We launched the final iteration of the product last year. And now we are scaling our product and building out new features.

## Technical Expectations

As a backend-focused engineer, you will mostly be:

- Building or updating integrations with third-party data sources (like CRMs and ad networks) using their public API
- Refactor parts of our backend code for accessibility and scalability

It’s good to have some or all of:

- SQL knowledge to update current queries or write new queries for feature support and performance optimization
- AWS experience to optimize our usage and carry out infrastructure-related tasks

Our backend is built upon Node.js and Express so you need to be very comfortable with Javascript.

The gist of this position is how good you are with reading through third-party APIs, handling and transforming large datasets with performance and scalability in mind, as well as the quality of the code you write.

## Non-technical Expectations

We aren’t looking for someone with 20 years of experience, we are looking for smart people who are up for a challenge.

We are looking for experience in analytics (either personally used or even built an analytics tool).

You should have experience with at least a CRM, a MarTech tool, or a CDP of some kind.

This is one of the founding roles for the company. Your ideas will set the course of the whole product, so you should have some context on this industry beforehand.

This also means that your role within the company is bound to grow and gain importance over time.

## Why HockeyStack?

The company is very young for where we want to be, but although this may scare some people off, we believe that this is a tremendous opportunity to actually build something greater than us. We have the fastest team in our market right now and we want to keep it that way. We are already becoming a market leader in the attribution space, but we need more teammates (aka you) for our more ambitious goals.

The expected base salary range for this role is **$130,000 to $160,000 per year**. Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and all employees receive salary + equity + benefits. Individual pay decisions are based on a number of factors, including qualifications for the role, experience level, skillset, and balancing internal equity relative to peers at the company.

Additional benefits include:

- Flexibility - we are sharing our time between the office and remote work.
- Joining a startup with some of the brightest minds in the industry.
- Office in the heart of San Francisco.
- Generous vacation policy (+ special company retreats)
- Working directly with the founders
