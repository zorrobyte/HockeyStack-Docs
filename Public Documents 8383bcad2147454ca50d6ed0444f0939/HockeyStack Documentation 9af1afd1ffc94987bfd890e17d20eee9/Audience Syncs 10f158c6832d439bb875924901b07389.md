# Audience Syncs

HockeyStack has data from your website, CRM, ad platforms, G2, Bombora, and every other platform we integrate with. While it helps you analyze your data, it can also turn this data into audiences for advertisement platforms. Right now, we work with LinkedIn. Google and Display audience sync integrations are coming very soon as well! 

## How to use it

To use this feature, you will first need to build a segment. Using HockeyStack’s segment feature, you can use different filters, goals, and properties to build a custom segment. 

Then, you’ll choose the segment on the journeys tab, and choose sync to ads platform:

You can edit settings and the names of your audiences at any time in settings:

The initial sync takes 2-3 days after that audiences refresh every 24 hours.
