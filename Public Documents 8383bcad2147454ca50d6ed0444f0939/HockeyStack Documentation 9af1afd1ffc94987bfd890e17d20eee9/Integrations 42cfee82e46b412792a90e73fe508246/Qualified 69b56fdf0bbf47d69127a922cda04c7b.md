# Qualified

HockeyStack’s Qualified integration automatically gets enabled when there is a Qualified chatbot on your website. The integration creates the following goals:

- **Qualified Email Captured**: When a visitor enters their email into any Qualified email input
- **Qualified Meeting Booked:** When a visitor books a meeting either through the chatbot or a form.
- **Qualified Conversation Started:** When a visitor starts a chatbot session

These goals allow HockeyStack to 

1. Identify more website visitors, and increase data quality
2. Use Qualified activity in reporting

# Examples using Qualified activity in reporting

### Compare lead quality between Qualified leads vs normal website leads
