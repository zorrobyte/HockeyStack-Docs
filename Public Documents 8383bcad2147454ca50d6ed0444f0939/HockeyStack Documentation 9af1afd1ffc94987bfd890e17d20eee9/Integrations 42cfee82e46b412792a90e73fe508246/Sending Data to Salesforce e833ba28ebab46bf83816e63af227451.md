# Sending Data to Salesforce

In order to send company lists back to Salesforce, you first need to create a property in the Account object to signify whether a company is in that list.

Watch this short video on how to create a property in Salesforce:

In the video, we created a property called `Custom Field` but you can give it any name you want. 

You should then copy the value you see under the “Name” column (which is `HockeyStack__Custom_Field__c` in this case) and paste it into the configuration modal in HockeyStack.
