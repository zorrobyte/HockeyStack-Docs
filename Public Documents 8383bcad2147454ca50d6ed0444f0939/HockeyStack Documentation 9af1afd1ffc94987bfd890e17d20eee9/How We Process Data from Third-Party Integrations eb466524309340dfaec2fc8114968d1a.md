# How We Process Data from Third-Party Integrations

As a data platform, HockeyStack is more powerful when it is connected with [other data sources](https://hockeystack.com/integrations). We can pull all kinds of marketing, sales, and even customer support data from these third-party tools. This guide aims to answer any concerns on the security side of this data flow.

Although the kind of data we pull differs vastly depending on the integration, we don’t process or store any data that you can’t see within your HockeyStack dashboard.

We need to store some PII (Personally Identifiable Information) for integrations such as CRMs and customer support tools in order to show you a full account-based journey. However this is limited to data such as:

- Email address (in most integrations that have a User entity)
- Contact name (in CRMs)
- Message content (in customer support tools)
