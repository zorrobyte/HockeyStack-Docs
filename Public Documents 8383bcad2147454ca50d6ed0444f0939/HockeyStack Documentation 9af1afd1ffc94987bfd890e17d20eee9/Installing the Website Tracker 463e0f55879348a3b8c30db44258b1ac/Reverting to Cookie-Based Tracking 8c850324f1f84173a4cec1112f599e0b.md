# Reverting to Cookie-Based Tracking

HockeyStack is cookieless by default. If you still want to use cookies to track unique visitors, you can revert to the old version by removing the `data-cookieless` attribute from your script or by removing the `script.dataset.cookieless = 1;` line.

We would love to hear your reason for using cookies. Let us know by emailing [hello@hockeystack.com](mailto:hello@hockeystack.com)!
