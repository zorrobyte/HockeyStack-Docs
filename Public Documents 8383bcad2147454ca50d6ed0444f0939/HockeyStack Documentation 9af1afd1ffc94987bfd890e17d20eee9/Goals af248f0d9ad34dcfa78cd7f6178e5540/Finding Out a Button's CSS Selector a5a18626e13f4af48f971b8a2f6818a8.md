# Finding Out a Button's CSS Selector

# Why define goals using the selector?

Although defining goals using the button text is much easier, sometimes it is not feasible.

1. If there isn't a text on the element you want to define as a goal
2. If the same text is used by multiple different elements on the same page and you only want to select one.

In other cases, we advise non-technical users to define their goals using text.

# How to get the CSS selector of a button

1. Hover the cursor over the button you want to define as a goal and right-click the mouse to select **Inspect**
