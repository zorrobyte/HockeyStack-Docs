Funnels are like multiple goals attached together. You define goals and funnels the same way. Check out [our guide to goal definition](Goals%20af248f0d9ad34dcfa78cd7f6178e5540.md) to learn how.

For each step, HockeyStack selects the users who have done **all of the previous steps + that step.** Hovering over the step shows you this number, as well as a few other useful metrics.

- **Step Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate from the previous step to the current step. A.k.a. the percentage of users in the previous step who have also done the current step.
- **Dropoff:** The percentage of people in the previous step who have not done the current step. Can be calculated by *100 - Step Conversion Rate*
- **Funnel Conversion Rate:** The conversion rate from the first step to the current step. A.k.a. the percentage of users in the first step who have also done the current step.
- **Avg Time Since Last Action:** The time it takes for users to pass from the previous step to the current step. For product managers, optimizing this time for your "Aha Moment" funnel is crucial.

ðŸ‘‰ If you have multiple similar funnels - funnels that differ by a step or two - you can duplicate a funnel and edit it in order to easily create all of your funnels.
