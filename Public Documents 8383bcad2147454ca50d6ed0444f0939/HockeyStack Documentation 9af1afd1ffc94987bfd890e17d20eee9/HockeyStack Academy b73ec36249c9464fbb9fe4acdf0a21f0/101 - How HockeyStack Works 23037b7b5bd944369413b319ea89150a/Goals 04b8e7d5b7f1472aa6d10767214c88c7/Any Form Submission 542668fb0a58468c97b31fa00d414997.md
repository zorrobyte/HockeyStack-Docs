# Any Form Submission

As you know, defining a form submission goal requires you to know the [selector](../../../Goals%20af248f0d9ad34dcfa78cd7f6178e5540/Finding%20Out%20a%20Button's%20CSS%20Selector%20a5a18626e13f4af48f971b8a2f6818a8.md) of the form. The “Any Form Submission” goal leverages the fact that all form selectors contain the word “form”. So our ruleset can just be “selector contains form”.
