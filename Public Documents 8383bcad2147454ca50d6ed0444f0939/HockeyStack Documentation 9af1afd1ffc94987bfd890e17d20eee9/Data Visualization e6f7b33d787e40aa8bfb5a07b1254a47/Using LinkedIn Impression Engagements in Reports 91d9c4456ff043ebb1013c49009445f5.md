# Using LinkedIn Impression/Engagements in Reports

As businesses use LinkedIn for marketing and recruiting, it is important to understand the effectiveness of their efforts. By keeping track of engagements and impressions on LinkedIn, businesses can measure their progress and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Engagements are interactions with an ad, such as clicks, likes, comments, and shares. Impressions are the number of viewers who have seen the ad.

HockeyStack can track campaign-level impression and engagement data for each company so that you can use them as any other action in your dashboard.
