# identity

Data Type: String
Description: Custom identity for the entity. Usually the email of a user so that we can merge its records throughout the data sources
Example: foo@bar.com
Notes: This is similar to the user_id column however it is a more general identifier that helps us merge actions by the same user through different data sources.
