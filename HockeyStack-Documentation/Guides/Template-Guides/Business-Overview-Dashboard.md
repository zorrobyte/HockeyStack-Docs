This is an eagle-eye view of your most important KPIs and allows for cross object reporting. Let‚Äôs get started! 

# Examples of Goals Needed to Build this Dashboard:

The KPIs you choose will be unique to your business. We often see folks pick the 5 main KPIs discussed in regular reporting and KPI meetings, for example MQL, SQL, Deal Created, Deal -  Pipeline Stage, Closed-Won. 

In this example, we only care about reporting on New Business for deal stages. This reflects the CRM report we use for regular reporting meetings and which we referenced to determine which KPIs to create in HockeyStack.
