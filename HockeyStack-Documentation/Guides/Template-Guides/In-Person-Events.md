This is a video guide repository for the [In-Person Events Template](https://hockeystack.com/templates/in-person-event-report)

A couple of notes on the pre-reading: 

**Track date properties** is the recommended way to build all CRM and MAP goals that have time stamps. Some of the videos below will walk you through the process while other will assume you‚Äôve set your goals up using Track Date Properties. 

You likely completed **Unified Channel** and **Unified Campaign** in your onboarding as part of the initial platform configuration.

For Cost data to show in these reports, you need to **sync spend from offline channels** via uploading a CSV in then HockeyStack Settings. Once synced Cost data will appear via the Paid Ads metrics > Spend Goal
