# Any Form Submission

As you know, defining a form submission goal requires you to know the [selector](../../../Goals/Finding-Out-a-Button's-CSS-Selector.md) of the form. The “Any Form Submission” goal leverages the fact that all form selectors contain the word “form”. So our ruleset can just be “selector contains form”.
