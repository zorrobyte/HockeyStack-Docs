# Step 3.1 - Build your first attribution report

<aside>
❗ Read the below guides before proceeding:

[Building a Basic Report](../101-How-HockeyStack-Works/Building-a-Basic-Report.md)

[Attribution Models](../101-How-HockeyStack-Works/Attribution-Models.md)

[Sequences](../101-How-HockeyStack-Works/Sequences.md)

After Step 2, we have everything we need to be able to build attribution reports!

Navigate to [Definitions > Reports and create a new report](https://hockeystack.com/dashboard/reports)

Our attribution report should have:

- **Numbers:**
    - Number of companies engaged with the channel
    - Spend per channel
    - Number of times done for each KPI
    - Conversion rates between each KPI
    - $ Amounts for Pipeline and Closed Won
    - ACV for Pipeline and Closed Won
    
    To keep this guide short, we will only build the below columns. The rest will be similar to at least one of the below:
    
    - Number of companies engaged with the channel
    - Spend per channel
    - Pipeline #
    - Pipeline $
    - Pipeline ACV
    - Pipeline → Closed Won conversion rate
- **Breakdown:**
    - Unified Channel
- **Filter:**
    - No filter — we want all companies to be shown
- **Attribution model:**
    - For all of these columns, we will use the Linear model to demonstrate, but you can use any model.
