If you've used any web analytics service before, you know the hassle of putting their code into your site. Fortunately, HockeyStack only requires one short snippet to track all your visitors' actions

You can copy the snippet from multiple places in the dashboard. If you havenâ€™t integrated yet, you should be able to see it in the integration steps. If you already integrated but need to update the script, you can copy it from **Settings > Domain Details > Integration Snippet**.

Paste the snippet into theÂ `<head></head>`Â tag of your site. Make sure this snippet is present onÂ *every page*Â that you want to track.

âœ… If you donâ€™t want to deal with any code or ask a developer to insert the snippet, you can directly add the snippet through GTM. Follow this guide on how to do it:

We can automatically collect all data from all platforms that allow custom script insertion.

## Tracking with Cookies

HockeyStack is by default cookie-less. However, you can convert your script to use cookies any time you want following this guide:
